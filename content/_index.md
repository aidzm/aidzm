# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I'm mtsk, otherwise known as aidzm (and a large number of other names ðŸ˜…), and am located in Malaysia. I like Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), Linux, and Cybersecurity.

Currently learning how to code to contribute back to the FOSS community which has given me so much. I am also running Fedora Kinoite.

Sometimes, I write out a blog post, which can be found at the header. There's also a few other pages which may be of interest to some.
