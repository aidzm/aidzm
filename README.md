# My Personal Website

This repository holds the code for my personal website. It is my first and hopefully one of many open source projects that I will create/contribute to.

## Technologies used

- [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola) - A Static Site Generator written in Rust
- [Duckquill](https://codeberg.org/daudix/duckquill) - A Modern, pretty, and clean Zola theme made by [David Lapshin](https://codeberg.org/daudix) (special thanks to David for helping me set up the site!)

## Building the Website

Install the latest version of [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola), clone the repository, and from the root of the repository, type

```
zola serve
```

Zola will build the website and start a web server, usually at
http://127.0.0.1:1111
